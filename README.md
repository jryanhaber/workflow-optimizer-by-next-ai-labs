Complete Project Roadmap

1. Core Capture Functionality (COMPLETED)

Web Page Capture: Screenshot, URL, and title capture from any page using Chrome extension API
Capture Categorization: Ability to categorize captures as Todo, In Progress, Waiting, or Completed items
Basic Data Storage: Local storage with Chrome storage API for persistence across sessions
Tag Management: Creating, applying, and filtering by custom tags
View Management: Card and list views for captured items

2. Real-Time Update System (IN PROGRESS)

Event Emitter Implementation: Create a pub/sub system in /utils/events.js to broadcast data changes
DataStore Enhancement: Update /storage/data-store.js to emit events when data changes
UI Reactivity: Make all UI components listen for and respond to data change events
Storage Synchronization: Ensure data changes propagate immediately across all open views

3. GTD Workflow Implementation (PLANNED)

GTD Data Model: Define GTD stages (Inbox, Actionable, Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday) in /core/storage/models.js
Stage Processing Logic: Create workflow rules for moving items between GTD stages in /gtd/gtd-workflow.js
Inbox Processing Interface: Build UI for quickly processing inbox items with single-question workflow
GTD Dashboard View: Implement kanban-style board showing items by GTD stage
Next Action Decision Trees: Create guided flows for determining next actions

4. NextAI Labs Custom Features (PLANNED)

Completion Questionnaire Flow: Build specialized workflows for completed items in /custom/nextai/completion-flow.js
Stakeholder Update Tracking: Implement system to track which completed items should be shared with investors, users, or team
Content Repurposing Flow: Create workflow for marking items for blog, changelog, email updates, or ads
Business-Specific Tags: Add automated tagging based on business context
Project Association: Connect items to specific NextAI projects or initiatives

5. User Experience Enhancements (PLANNED)

Expanded Item View: Create click-to-expand functionality for viewing details without modal dialogs
Real-Time Updates: Make dashboard automatically refresh when items change
Advanced Filtering: Implement multi-tag filtering and saved filter presets
List View Enhancement: Add customizable columns and sorting options to list view
Keyboard Shortcuts: Implement keyboard navigation and shortcuts for rapid workflow

6. Plugin Architecture (FUTURE)

Extension Points: Create system for plugging in custom workflows
User Customization: Allow users to define their own workflow rules
Import/Export: Implement data portability features
API Integration: Create hooks for connecting with external systems
Workflow Templates: Provide pre-built workflow templates for different use cases

Each of these areas has clear deliverables and requirements that build on each other to create a comprehensive workflow capture and management system.To fix the current issues, we should focus first on implementing the basic events system and fixing the review.js file to properly handle the list view toggle.
